# Task Manager

This project is a task manager that uses NestJs for the management and structure of the server. TypeOrm is used for database mapping (in this case, postgresSQL) and GraphQL to manage the queries and API structure.

## Technologies used

- NestJs: Node.js framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.

- TypeOrm: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) used to map TypeScript objects to database entities.

- GraphQL: Query language and runtime environment for APIs, providing an efficient and flexible way to interact with data.

## Project Configuration

    1. Clone the repository: git clone [repository URL]
    2. Install the dependencies: npm install
    3. Configure the database in the ormconfig.json file.
    4. Run the server: npm run start
